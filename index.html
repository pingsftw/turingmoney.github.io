<h1>
  Turing is Community
</h1>
<p>
  Welcome to the Turing project! We are a community of people who support
  the open internet, and this project is a currency designed to support our
  cause. When you buy Turing you increase the value of the currency already
  in the hands of the projects working to help the net, and you can vote
  on which projects get funding priority as new Turing is issued.
